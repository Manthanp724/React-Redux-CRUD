React + Vite

This project demonstrates my understanding and implementation of React with Redux Toolkit for state management. It incorporates several core features of the Redux Toolkit, such as:

Key Features of Redux Toolkit
Slices: Organize reducers and actions in a modular way.
Redux Thunks: Handle asynchronous logic and API requests.
Selectors: Retrieve specific pieces of state more efficiently.
Immutability: Ensure that state is updated without direct mutation using Immer, which is integrated into Redux Toolkit.
Features
Efficient state management with minimal boilerplate code.
API integration for fetching and updating data asynchronously using Redux Thunks.
Well-structured and scalable folder organization for components, slices, and services.
Technologies Used
React: For building the user interface.
Redux Toolkit: To manage global state.
React-Redux: To connect React components to the Redux store.
Redux Thunks: To handle side effects and async logic.
Axios: For making HTTP requests to external APIs.
CSS Modules: For styling components.
Vite Plugins
Currently, two official plugins are available for Vite:

@vitejs/plugin-react: Uses Babel for Fast Refresh.
@vitejs/plugin-react-swc: Uses SWC for Fast Refresh.
